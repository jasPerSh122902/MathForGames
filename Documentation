This applictation is meant to be a test for the roation, translation on a 3D plane. 
This applictation also uses the 4D vectors and 3D vectors.

To open the appliction you will need to acsess the >>.exe<< files that is the activation file for the appliction.
You will get the file in in a zip file and will come with it so you can start as fast a possible.
The appliction will start and all you will see is your player and the enemy going to attack you .
>>As said before this applictation is meant to be a test for the vector 3 and 4 while using the roation and translation.
So the applictation is quite short.<<
